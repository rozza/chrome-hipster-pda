About
-----

I saw taskboard lite from the 10k Apart competition and thought it was awesome 
and something I could really use daily.

I also use chrome as my main browser so adding it as my background tab I 
would see my list often.

I also love MooTools but haven't used it in years, so I thought I'd look into 
it again and have a play round after being in jQuery land.

Future
------

* Grouping - Add element stack style grouping of tags and dragging of them.
* Sync across computers.

Inspired by the awesome: 
    * Taskboard Lite (https://github.com/bartaz/taskboard-lite)
    * Chrome-todo (https://github.com/benhiller/chrome-todo)
